# Agent-Based-Model-of-NLC-in-CLL

## Summary
This repository contains data related to an agent-based model describing the differentiation dynamics of monocytes into tumour-associated macrophages upon contact with cancer B cells in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The goal of this ABM is to reproduce dynamics compatible with an *in vitro* experimental setting of monocytes differentiation in presence of leukemic (B-CLL).

## Project organisation
- **netlogo** source file for the agent-based model, in NetLogo
- **openmole** source files for exploring the model on the OpenMOLE platform https://openmole.org
- **figures** source files to generate the figures and analysis of the related publication
