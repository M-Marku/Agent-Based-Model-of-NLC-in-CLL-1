# Agent-Based-Model-of-NLC-in-CLL

## Summary
This repository contains data related to an agent-based model describing the differentiation dynamics of monocytes into tumour-associated macrophages upon contact with cancer B cells in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The goal of this ABM is to reproduce dynamics compatible with an *in vitro* experimental setting of monocytes differentiation in presence of leukemic (B-CLL).
